# AQI Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to analyze air quality data effectively.

## Dataset
- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
- It contains air quality-related parameters necessary for AQI prediction.

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Importing Libraries:** Uses `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data handling and visualization.
2. **Loading the Data:** Reads the dataset and checks its structure.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans the data, handles missing values, and selects relevant features.
4. **Model Training:** Trains a machine learning model for AQI prediction.
5. **Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Conclusion
This project provides a structured approach to AQI prediction by leveraging data analysis and machine learning. Improvements can be made by optimizing feature selection and exploring different models.
